# Qt-to-HTML
Qt designer UI file to HTML form converter

Designig HTML forms for non web developers is a PIA.
- I used QtCreator for few of my projects and Glade too. But never Web Technology. For my other project "[Scarlet](https://github.com/dasbluehole/scarlet)" i needed some forms to test. i know how much difficult it was to make a HTML file. 

- secondly Using existing tools to code for new project is always a good practice. Hence if some one is porting some Qt code to Web Technology then this may help.
